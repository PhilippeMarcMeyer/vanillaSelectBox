# vanillaSelectBox
### A nice select/multiselect ui with no dependency

# WIP : 
### vanillaSelectBox is not currently in v1+, please test it carefully before using it in production (interactions with other plugins, css) and be kind enough to report any bug to me so I can improve it.

### Transform an HTML select into a selectBox dropdown
#### the select is hidden and the chosen value(s) is/are available in the source select

```
let selectBox = new vanillaSelectBox("#brands",{"maxHeight":200,search:true});
```
* param 1 : css selector of a normal select element
* param 2 : options 

### Available options : 
* maxWidth : for the UI if you don't want the title to expand to much to the right
* maxHeight : the maxHeight set a scroll when there are too many items 
* translations : { "all": "every cars", "items": "cars" }
* search : true/false, to provide a search input text to reduce the list
* placeHolder : well that's a placeholder !
* stayOpen : true/false. defaut is false : that's a drop-down. Set it to true and that"s a list (>= v 0.25)

### Automatic options :
* single or multiple choices : depends on the "multiple" attribute that you put in the select code 
* size : if you set a multiple attribute and a size attribute in the select (for instance 3) :
  * the title zone will enumerate the chosen values as a comma separated string until it reaches "size"
  * Above it will show "x items" or "x" + whatever you put in the translations.items key
  * If all the items are selected, it will show "all" or whatever you put in the translations.items all

```
<select id="brands" multiple size="3">
```
### Available commands :
* empty()
* setValue([] || '' || 'all') => the multiple uses an array of values or a comma separated string or the string 'all'
* disable()
* enable()
* destroy()
* enableItems([] || '') => array of values or comma delimited list
* disableItems([] || '') => array of values or comma delimited list
```
selectBox = new vanillaSelectBox("#brandsOne", { "maxHeight": 200, "search": true, "placeHolder": "Choose a brand..." });
 selectBox.disableItems(['Lamborghini','Land Rover']);
```
#### History :

v 0.41 : Bug corrected, the menu content was misplaced if a css transform was applied on a parent

v 0.40 : A click on one selectBox close the other opened boxes

v 0.35 : You can enable and disable items. The already disble options of the select are also used at init time.

v 0.30 : The menu stops moving around on window resize and scroll + z-index in order of creation for multiple instances

v 0.26 : Corrected bug in stayOpen mode with disable() function

v 0.25 : New option stayOpen, and the dropbox is no longer a dropbox but a nice multi-select

v 0.22 : Migrating the function to vanillaSelectBox prototype => several instances of vanillaSelectBox() but 1 set of functions in memory
 
v 0.21 : IE 11 compatibility

v 0.20 : working selectBox both single and multiple choices, with search-box !

v 0.10 : functional plugin for both single and multiple selects, without search box for the moment

v 0.02 : added dispatch change event to select + nicer check mark

v 0.01 : first commit => basics for a single select box + the Dom is cleaned if you init twice
